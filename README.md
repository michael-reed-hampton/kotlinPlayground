# ScratchPad

I am using this to evaluate techniques, and for looking at kotlin too.  This is mostly a learning scratchpad, but I am using it for a lot of things.

Currently, this has few dependencies.  The projects were not working on the some hardware, so I was testing them on an emulator.  The error I was seeing was related to ClassNotFound errors for androidx stuff.  Not **real** concerned about it, but will need to address those issues if I end up using these things on that hardware.
